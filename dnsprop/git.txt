DESCRIPTION
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
       unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and
       full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see Everyday Git[1] for a
       useful minimum set of commands. The Git User’s Manual[2] has a more
       in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page
       to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual
       Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual page gives you
       an overview of the command-line command syntax.

       Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest Git documentation can
       be viewed at http://git-htmldocs.googlecode.com/git/git.html.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands.
           If the option --all or -a is given then all available commands are
           printed. If a Git command is named this option will bring up the
           manual page for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is
           displayed. See git-help(1) for more information, because git --help
           ...  is converted internally into git help ....

       -C <path>
           Run as if git was started in <path> instead of the current working
           directory. When multiple -C options are given, each subsequent
           non-absolute -C <path> is interpreted relative to the preceding -C
           <path>.

           This option affects options that expect path name like --git-dir
           and --work-tree in that their interpretations of the path names
           would be made relative to the working directory caused by the -C
           option. For example the following invocations are equivalent:

               git --git-dir=a.git --work-tree=b -C c status
               git --git-dir=c/a.git --work-tree=c/b status

       -c <name>=<value>
           Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value given will
           override values from configuration files. The <name> is expected in
           the same format as listed by git config (subkeys separated by
           dots).

           Note that omitting the = in git -c foo.bar ...  is allowed and sets
           foo.bar to the boolean true value (just like [foo]bar would in a
           config file). Including the equals but with an empty value (like
           git -c foo.bar= ...) sets foo.bar to the empty string.

       --exec-path[=<path>]
           Path to wherever your core Git programs are installed. This can
           also be controlled by setting the GIT_EXEC_PATH environment
           variable. If no path is given, git will print the current setting
           and then exit.

       --html-path
           Print the path, without trailing slash, where Git’s HTML
           documentation is installed and exit.

       --man-path
           Print the manpath (see man(1)) for the man pages for this version
           of Git and exit.

       --info-path
           Print the path where the Info files documenting this version of Git
           are installed and exit.

       -p, --paginate
           Pipe all output into less (or if set, $PAGER) if standard output is
           a terminal. This overrides the pager.<cmd> configuration options
           (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section below).

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe Git output into a pager.

       --git-dir=<path>
           Set the path to the repository. This can also be controlled by
           setting the GIT_DIR environment variable. It can be an absolute
           path or relative path to current working directory.

       --work-tree=<path>
           Set the path to the working tree. It can be an absolute path or a
           path relative to the current working directory. This can also be
           controlled by setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable and
           the core.worktree configuration variable (see core.worktree in git-
           config(1) for a more detailed discussion).

       --namespace=<path>
           Set the Git namespace. See gitnamespaces(7) for more details.
           Equivalent to setting the GIT_NAMESPACE environment variable.

       --bare
           Treat the repository as a bare repository. If GIT_DIR environment
           is not set, it is set to the current working directory.

       --no-replace-objects
           Do not use replacement refs to replace Git objects. See git-
           replace(1) for more information.

       --literal-pathspecs
           Treat pathspecs literally (i.e. no globbing, no pathspec magic).
           This is equivalent to setting the GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS environment
           variable to 1.

       --glob-pathspecs
           Add "glob" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting the
           GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS environment variable to 1. Disabling globbing on
           individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic ":(literal)"

       --noglob-pathspecs
           Add "literal" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting
           the GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS environment variable to 1. Enabling
           globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic
           ":(glob)"

       --icase-pathspecs
           Add "icase" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting
           the GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS environment variable to 1.

LOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)
       Although Git includes its own porcelain layer, its low-level commands
       are sufficient to support development of alternative porcelains.
       Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about git-update-
       index(1) and git-read-tree(1).

       The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to
       these low-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than
       Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for
       scripted use. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are
       subject to change in order to improve the end user experience.

       The following description divides the low-level commands into commands
       that manipulate objects (in the repository, index, and working tree),
       commands that interrogate and compare objects, and commands that move
       objects and references between repositories.

CONFIGURATION MECHANISM
       Git uses a simple text format to store customizations that are per
       repository and are per user. Such a configuration file may look like
       this:

           #
           # A '#' or ';' character indicates a comment.
           #

           ; core variables
           [core]
                   ; Don't trust file modes
                   filemode = false

           ; user identity

       Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust their
       operation accordingly. See git-config(1) for a list and more details
       about the configuration mechanism.

IDENTIFIER TERMINOLOGY
       <object>
           Indicates the object name for any type of object.

       <blob>
           Indicates a blob object name.

       <tree>
           Indicates a tree object name.

       <commit>
           Indicates a commit object name.

       <tree-ish>
           Indicates a tree, commit or tag object name. A command that takes a
           <tree-ish> argument ultimately wants to operate on a <tree> object
           but automatically dereferences <commit> and <tag> objects that
           point at a <tree>.

       <commit-ish>
           Indicates a commit or tag object name. A command that takes a
           <commit-ish> argument ultimately wants to operate on a <commit>
           object but automatically dereferences <tag> objects that point at a
           <commit>.

       <type>
           Indicates that an object type is required. Currently one of: blob,
           tree, commit, or tag.

       <file>
           Indicates a filename - almost always relative to the root of the
           tree structure GIT_INDEX_FILE describes.

SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS
       Any Git command accepting any <object> can also use the following
       symbolic notation:

       HEAD
           indicates the head of the current branch.

       <tag>
           a valid tag name (i.e. a refs/tags/<tag> reference).

       <head>
           a valid head name (i.e. a refs/heads/<head> reference).

       For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING
       REVISIONS" section in gitrevisions(7).

FILE/DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
       Please see the gitrepository-layout(5) document.

       Read githooks(5) for more details about each hook.

       Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional information in the
       $GIT_DIR.

TERMINOLOGY
       Please see gitglossary(7).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Various Git commands use the following environment variables:

   The Git Repository
       These environment variables apply to all core Git commands. Nb: it is
       worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above Git
       so take care if using Cogito etc.

       GIT_INDEX_FILE
           This environment allows the specification of an alternate index
           file. If not specified, the default of $GIT_DIR/index is used.

       GIT_INDEX_VERSION
           This environment variable allows the specification of an index
           version for new repositories. It won’t affect existing index files.
           By default index file version [23] is used.

       GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment
           variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath -
           otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

       GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
           Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be
           archived into shared, read-only directories. This variable
           specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of Git
           object directories which can be used to search for Git objects. New
           objects will not be written to these directories.

       GIT_DIR
           If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path
           to use instead of the default .git for the base of the repository.
           The --git-dir command-line option also sets this value.

       GIT_WORK_TREE
           Set the path to the root of the working tree. This can also be
           controlled by the --work-tree command-line option and the
           core.worktree configuration variable.

       GIT_NAMESPACE
           Set the Git namespace; see gitnamespaces(7) for details. The
           --namespace command-line option also sets this value.

       GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
           This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If set, it
           is a list of directories that Git should not chdir up into while
           looking for a repository directory (useful for excluding
           slow-loading network directories). It will not exclude the current
           working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in the
           environment. Normally, Git has to read the entries in this list and
           resolve any symlink that might be present in order to compare them
           with the current directory. However, if even this access is slow,
           you can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git that the
           subsequent entries are not symlinks and needn’t be resolved; e.g.,
           GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink.

       GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
           When run in a directory that does not have ".git" repository
           directory, Git tries to find such a directory in the parent
           directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it
           does not cross filesystem boundaries. This environment variable can
           be set to true to tell Git not to stop at filesystem boundaries.
           Like GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, this will not affect an explicit
           repository directory set via GIT_DIR or on the command line.

   Git Commits
       GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME,
       GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL, GIT_COMMITTER_DATE, EMAIL
           see git-commit-tree(1)

   Git Diffs
       GIT_DIFF_OPTS
           Only valid setting is "--unified=??" or "-u??" to set the number of
           context lines shown when a unified diff is created. This takes
           precedence over any "-U" or "--unified" option value passed on the
           Git diff command line.

       GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
           When the environment variable GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is set, the program
           named by it is called, instead of the diff invocation described
           above. For a path that is added, removed, or modified,
           GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 7 parameters:

               path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode

           where:

       <old|new>-file
           are files GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use to read the contents of
           <old|new>,

       <old|new>-hex
           are the 40-hexdigit SHA-1 hashes,

       <old|new>-mode
           are the octal representation of the file modes.

           The file parameters can point at the user’s working file (e.g.
           new-file in "git-diff-files"), /dev/null (e.g.  old-file when a new
           file is added), or a temporary file (e.g.  old-file in the index).
           GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF should not worry about unlinking the temporary
           file --- it is removed when GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF exits.

           For a path that is unmerged, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 1
           parameter, <path>.

           For each path GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called, two environment
           variables, GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER and GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL are set.

       GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER
           A 1-based counter incremented by one for every path.

       GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL
           The total number of paths.

   other
       GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY
           A number controlling the amount of output shown by the recursive
           merge strategy. Overrides merge.verbosity. See git-merge(1)

       GIT_PAGER
           This environment variable overrides $PAGER. If it is set to an
           empty string or to the value "cat", Git will not launch a pager.
           See also the core.pager option in git-config(1).

       GIT_EDITOR
           This environment variable overrides $EDITOR and $VISUAL. It is used
           by several Git commands when, on interactive mode, an editor is to
           be launched. See also git-var(1) and the core.editor option in git-
           config(1).

       GIT_SSH
           If this environment variable is set then git fetch and git push
           will use this command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a
           remote system. The $GIT_SSH command will be given exactly two or
           four arguments: the username@host (or just host) from the URL and
           the shell command to execute on that remote system, optionally
           preceded by -p (literally) and the port from the URL when it
           specifies something other than the default SSH port.

           To pass options to the program that you want to list in GIT_SSH you
           will need to wrap the program and options into a shell script, then
           set GIT_SSH to refer to the shell script.

           Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your
           personal .ssh/config file. Please consult your ssh documentation
           for further details.

       GIT_ASKPASS
           If this environment variable is set, then Git commands which need
           to acquire passwords or passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP
           authentication) will call this program with a suitable prompt as
           command-line argument and read the password from its STDOUT. See
           also the core.askpass option in git-config(1).

       GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
           Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide
           $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig file. This environment variable can be used
           along with $HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME to create a predictable
           environment for a picky script, or you can set it temporarily to
           avoid using a buggy /etc/gitconfig file while waiting for someone
           with sufficient permissions to fix it.

       GIT_FLUSH
           If this environment variable is set to "1", then commands such as
           git blame (in incremental mode), git rev-list, git log, git
           check-attr and git check-ignore will force a flush of the output
           stream after each record have been flushed. If this variable is set
           to "0", the output of these commands will be done using completely
           buffered I/O. If this environment variable is not set, Git will
           choose buffered or record-oriented flushing based on whether stdout
           appears to be redirected to a file or not.

       GIT_TRACE
           Enables general trace messages, e.g. alias expansion, built-in
           command execution and external command execution.

           If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case
           insensitive), trace messages will be printed to stderr.

           If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2 and lower
           than 10 (strictly) then Git will interpret this value as an open
           file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into this
           file descriptor.

           Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path (starting
           with a / character), Git will interpret this as a file path and
           will try to write the trace messages into it.

           Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or "false"
           (case insensitive) disables trace messages.

       GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS
           Enables trace messages for all accesses to any packs. For each
           access, the pack file name and an offset in the pack is recorded.
           This may be helpful for troubleshooting some pack-related
           performance problems. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output
           options.

       GIT_TRACE_PACKET
           Enables trace messages for all packets coming in or out of a given
           program. This can help with debugging object negotiation or other
           protocol issues. Tracing is turned off at a packet starting with
           "PACK". See GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

       GIT_TRACE_PERFORMANCE
           Enables performance related trace messages, e.g. total execution
           time of each Git command. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output
           options.

       GIT_TRACE_SETUP
           Enables trace messages printing the .git, working tree and current
           working directory after Git has completed its setup phase. See
           GIT_TRACE for available trace output options.

       GIT_TRACE_SHALLOW
           Enables trace messages that can help debugging fetching / cloning
           of shallow repositories. See GIT_TRACE for available trace output
           options.

       GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs
           literally, rather than as glob patterns. For example, running
           GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1 git log -- '*.c' will search for commits
           that touch the path *.c, not any paths that the glob *.c matches.
           You might want this if you are feeding literal paths to Git (e.g.,
           paths previously given to you by git ls-tree, --raw diff output,
           etc).

       GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as
           glob patterns (aka "glob" magic).

       GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as
           literal (aka "literal" magic).

       GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as
           case-insensitive.

       GIT_REFLOG_ACTION
           When a ref is updated, reflog entries are created to keep track of
           the reason why the ref was updated (which is typically the name of
           the high-level command that updated the ref), in addition to the
           old and new values of the ref. A scripted Porcelain command can use
           set_reflog_action helper function in git-sh-setup to set its name
           to this variable when it is invoked as the top level command by the
           end user, to be recorded in the body of the reflog.

DISCUSSION
       More detail on the following is available from the Git concepts chapter
       of the user-manual[3] and gitcore-tutorial(7).

       A Git project normally consists of a working directory with a ".git"
       subdirectory at the top level. The .git directory contains, among other
       things, a compressed object database representing the complete history
       of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current
       contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such
       as tags and branch heads.

       The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which
       hold file data; trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up
       directory hierarchies; and commits, which each reference a single tree
       and some number of parent commits.

       The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or
       "version", represents a step in the project’s history, and each parent
       represents an immediately preceding step. Commits with more than one
       parent represent merges of independent lines of development.

       All objects are named by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, normally
       written as a string of 40 hex digits. Such names are globally unique.
       The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for by signing
       just that commit. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this
       purpose.

       When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for
       efficiency may later be compressed together into "pack files".

       Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history. A ref
       may contain the SHA-1 name of an object or the name of another ref.
       Refs with names beginning ref/head/ contain the SHA-1 name of the most
       recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development. SHA-1 names of
       tags of interest are stored under ref/tags/. A special ref named HEAD
       contains the name of the currently checked-out branch.

       The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each
       path, a blob object and a set of attributes. The blob object represents
       the contents of the file as of the head of the current branch. The
       attributes (last modified time, size, etc.) are taken from the
       corresponding file in the working tree. Subsequent changes to the
       working tree can be found by comparing these attributes. The index may
       be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the
       content stored in the index.

       The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages")
       for a given pathname. These stages are used to hold the various
       unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress.

FURTHER DOCUMENTATION
       See the references in the "description" section to get started using
       Git. The following is probably more detail than necessary for a
       first-time user.

       The Git concepts chapter of the user-manual[3] and gitcore-tutorial(7)
       both provide introductions to the underlying Git architecture.

       See gitworkflows(7) for an overview of recommended workflows.

       See also the howto[4] documents for some useful examples.

       The internals are documented in the Git API documentation[5].

       Users migrating from CVS may also want to read gitcvs-migration(7).

       GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL
           If set, provide a colon-separated list of protocols which are
           allowed to be used with fetch/push/clone. This is useful to
           restrict recursive submodule initialization from an untrusted
           repository. Any protocol not mentioned will be disallowed (i.e.,
           this is a whitelist, not a blacklist). If the variable is not set
           at all, all protocols are enabled. The protocol names currently
           used by git are:

           ·   file: any local file-based path (including file:// URLs, or
               local paths)

           ·   git: the anonymous git protocol over a direct TCP connection
               (or proxy, if configured)

           ·   ssh: git over ssh (including host:path syntax, git+ssh://,
               etc).

           ·   rsync: git over rsync

           ·   http: git over http, both "smart http" and "dumb http". Note
               that this does not include https; if you want both, you should
               specify both as http:https.

           ·   any external helpers are named by their protocol (e.g., use hg
               to allow the git-remote-hg helper)
